This is a old program I made in 2018 where I connected dots between two circles with different radii. There are points along the circles and each point in a circle connects to
every point in the other circle. The main purpose of this program was to draw something pretty on the paper as well as being a way of learning more programming. I had also been
drawing similar pattern by hand before and was curious of how complex I could make the patterns using a computer since it was way faster then using pen and paper. Now afterwards
it isn't the most complex work in the world and it lacks commenting but then again I never originally made it to show off my skills as a coder.
