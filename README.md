# Old-Work

Hello, this is Marcus!

This is old code I have made over the years. The files range from work created in 2018-2021 and consists of code I made for my own enjoyment. The languages I use are mostly Python and Javascript. Since these are projects made for fun they mostly consist of visualisations and use the opensource visual library P5! I hope you enjoy!

Go into a year and download a folder and run the index.html file to run the program!
